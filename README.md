# Summer-Olympic-Analysis
The Olympic Games is a well-known sporting platform which is recognized all over the world, has been distinguished from the late 19th century. Its origin however can be traced back to the Greek empire, at around 3,000 years ago, which consisted only of sprint race, and was held in Greeceâ€™s city Olympia only accessible to freeborn Greek people (Young & Abraham, 2020). It has grown since then and now has become a hub for all the athletes worldwide to demonstrate their abilities in more than 28 individual sporting contests. Currently, it is held every 2 years in different countries, with names Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics, both having their own set of games (Young & Abraham, 2020). It has become a place which reflects the power of the individual contestants and has become a source of pride for the countries they represent.
